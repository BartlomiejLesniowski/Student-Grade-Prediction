# Student-Grade-Prediction

Description from Kaggle.com - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption/data

"The data were obtained in a survey of students math and portuguese language courses in secondary school. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students. You can use it for some EDA or try to predict students final grade."

My goal is to create the prediction model, that will predict if student pass the exam or fail. 

In this project I will convert all categorical features into numbers.
